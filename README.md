### Project to knowledge share SSR & APIs
This project is intended to act as an example of how to use express server for server side rendering as well as an brief intro into API's. 

It queries the pokemon api and display information on a requested pokemon!

TODO: next time
- the views using hbs engine is introduced too quickly. add more steps for this. for e.g. add it in to the 'Hello ${name}' examples
